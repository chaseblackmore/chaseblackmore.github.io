<p> Throughout my time spent at the University of Oklahoma I have completed numerous projects, including this website as an example. One big project I am proud of is from my Database Management course (MIS 3353) in which we developed a full database for a company which includes an ERD, formalizing the data into a database, and implmenting SQL scripts to run reports </p>
<p> Other projects that I have done come from programming courses I have taken during my undergrad career, attached below are some examples of programs I have written and a brief explanation of what they do. </p>
