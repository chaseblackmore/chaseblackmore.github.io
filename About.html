        <p> Hello! if you are reading this page I would assume you would like to learn a little bit more about me. My name is Chase Blackmore and I created this page for a MIS 3033 project but it also features some information about me, skills, and projects I have worked on. For starters, I am from Bixby, Oklahoma (or south Tulsa) and my expected graduation date is May 2020</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> Throughout my time spent at the University of Oklahoma I have completed numerous projects, including this website as an example. One big project I am proud of is from my Database Management course (MIS 3353) in which we developed a full database for a company which includes an ERD, formalizing the data into a database, and implmenting SQL scripts to run reports </p>
        <p> Other projects that I have done come from programming courses I have taken during my undergrad career, attached below are some examples of programs I have written and a brief explanation of what they do. </p>
